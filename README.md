This project is a web-based presentation titled "Arranging a List" by Rishabh Patel (25MIM10131). It explores sorting strategies in Python, contrasting the productivity of built-in methods (.sort()) with the algorithmic depth of Bubble Sort. The slides are built using HTML and CSS for a responsive, dark-mode experience.
